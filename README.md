Created Using React, Redux & Firebase.

This project was a redesign of inshorts desktop app. Check out the whole process at [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/92443015/UX-Inshorts-Redesign-Develop).

## What it does
It fetches daily news for users, which they can bookmark, report or look for similar stuff.

## Why is it better
The current version (Inshorts desktop app - 2019) doesn't supports basic features that they have for their mobile app.
This has all those features and is based on material design guidelines.


## What it lacks?
It's not responsive. It was a part of the development course at my university so made this while I was learning about the technology. The code is not quite optimized. It was a three weeks course.

*The project was a part of my learning experience and is no longer maintained.*
